<h1>The Met Landing</h1>
Welcome to The Met Landing project! 

This repository hosts the code for a landing page dedicated to showcasing The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

- [DEMO LINK](https://metrakonon.github.io/the-met-landing/)


## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3: Grid, Flexbox
- BEM methodology: [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/)
- Preprocessors: [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learned how to apply grid to the hole page
- How to structure my code by separating everything into its own file
- How to use most of the features of SASS (cycles, functions, mixins, etc.)
